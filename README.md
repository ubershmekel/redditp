## Features

* All /r/ subreddits, including different ?sort stuff.
* /user/ , /domain/ , /me/ url's work.
* Url's ending with ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif', '.bmp', '.png']
* You can save the html file locally and use it, just make sure you add a separator e.g. the question mark in file:///c/myredditp.html?/r/gifs so the browser knows to pick up the right file and go to the right subreddit.
* Support for /r/random and /r/randnsfw virtual subreddits. These'll be tricky unless I cheat as they contain redirects.

Possible future features, depending on feedback:
* Zoom/Pan for comics
* Imgur albums support
* Offline access support, though I don't know if this is even possible actually (caching external image resources).
* Login and upvoting support

## Host your own redditp

Redditp relies on the `/r/subreddit` in the URL to fetch the JSON from the corresponding reddit endpoint. There are a few ways you can set up support for these URLs yourself:

* You can use an Apache server with the `.htaccess` file.
* Host on Netlify using the `_redirects` file. This is the current host for redditp.
* Use NodeJS (see `package.json`).
* Use a simple HTTP server and put the subreddit URL in the get parameters like `http://localhost?/r/subreddit`.
* Use GitHub pages by copying `index.html` into `404.html` which will make all unknown URLs reach the same `index.html`. This currently only works with a custom domain because of where the `.js` and `.css` files are located.
