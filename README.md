A full screen reddit presentation or slide show.

Hotkeys
-------

* a - toggles auto-next (play/pause)
* t - collapse/uncollapse title
* c - collapse/uncollapse controls
* Arrow keys, pgup/pgdown, spacebar change slides
* Swipe gestures on phones

Features
--------

* All /r/ subreddits, including different ?sort stuff.
* /user/ and /domain/ url's work now.
* Url's ending with ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif', '.bmp', '.png']
* Local usage without webserver. (index.html#/r/aww)

Possible future features, depending on feedback:
* Zoom/Pan for comics
* Imgur albums support
* Support for /r/random and /r/randnsfw virtual subreddits. These'll be tricky unless I cheat as they contain redirects.
* Offline access support, though I don't know if this is even possible actually (caching external image resources).
