redditp
=======

A full screen reddit presentation or slide show.

http://redditp.com

Hotkeys
-------

* a - toggles auto-next (play/pause)
* t - collapse/uncollapse title
* c - collapse/uncollapse controls
* i - open image in a new tab
* r - open comments in a new tab 
* Arrow keys, pgup/pgdown, spacebar change slides
* Swipe gestures on phones

Features
--------

* All /r/ subreddits, including different ?sort stuff.
* /user/ , /domain/ , /me/ url's work.
* Url's ending with ['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif', '.bmp', '.png']
* You can save the html file locally and use it, just make sure you add a separator e.g. the question mark in file:///c/myredditp.html?/r/gifs so the browser knows to pick up the right file and go to the right subreddit.

Possible future features, depending on feedback:
* Zoom/Pan for comics
* Imgur albums support
* Support for /r/random and /r/randnsfw virtual subreddits. These'll be tricky unless I cheat as they contain redirects.
* Offline access support, though I don't know if this is even possible actually (caching external image resources).
